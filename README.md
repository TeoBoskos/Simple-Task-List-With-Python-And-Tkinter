# My Todo List
This is a very simple todo list made using Python and Tkinter.

## Components.
The app consists of a label, an entry, a button and, if added, checkbuttons.

## How It Functions
When the user inputs text into the entry and presses the add button, the app creates a checkbutton
right below the entry field, with the text that the user wrote. If checked, the checkbutton will get
deleted after seven seconds.

## Why I Made It
This app was made just for practice, and since I am relatively new to tkinter, there are a lot of
flaws in this app (like a functioning scrollbar).

I am open to all kinds of criticism that is going to help me improve my skills.

Thank you for reading.
